### Patch Changes

- [#5](https://github.com/typemf/typemf/pull/5) [`5123e20`](https://github.com/typemf/typemf/commit/5123e20130003e8eb4cdc9dd64376e312cd197aa) Thanks [@bergerbd](https://github.com/bergerbd)! - Fix two related bugs around unresolved cross-document references (proxies):

  - Reading a feature of an unresolved proxy (e.g. `book.getAuthor().getName()` before the author's
    document has loaded) threw `Cannot read a feature of an unresolved proxy`. A proxy is now a
    real instance of the target class, created through its own factory, and returns that class's
    own normal default until resolved - no more throwing.
  - Adding an unresolved proxy to any reference that has an `eOpposite` threw for the same reason,
    which made loading a bidirectional cross-document reference fail outright (confirmed for XMI),
    and made opening a `.ecore` file with more than one classifier show only the first one in the
    TypeMF Instance Editor (the editor's own webview reconstructs containment children as
    unresolved proxies by default).
  - `ResourceSet.resolve()` located and returned the real, loaded object but never updated the
    reference that pointed at the proxy - a later read of the same feature still saw the stale
    proxy. New `ResourceSet.resolveFeature(container, feature)` resolves the current value and
    writes the resolved object back into `container`'s own feature, firing a `RESOLVE`
    notification.

  `ProxyEObjectImpl` is no longer exported; it is replaced by `createProxy()`/`getProxyURI()` in
  `@typemf/core`, used internally by `@typemf/xmi`, `@typemf/json` and `@typemf/generator`'s
  `.ecore` loader. Code that imported `ProxyEObjectImpl` directly should use these functions and
  the `EObject.eIsProxy()` check instead.
